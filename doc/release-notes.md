How to Upgrade
==============

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the 
installer (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt` (on Mac)
or `bitcoind`/`bitcoin-qt` (on Linux).

The first time you run version 0.15.0 or higher, your chainstate database will
be converted to a new format, which will take anywhere from a few minutes to
half an hour, depending on the speed of your machine.

The file format of `fee_estimates.dat` changed in version 0.15.0. Hence, a
downgrade from version 0.15 or upgrade to version 0.15 will cause all fee
estimates to be discarded.

Note that the block database format also changed in version 0.8.0 and there is no
automatic upgrade code from before version 0.8 to version 0.15.0. Upgrading
directly from 0.7.x and earlier without redownloading the blockchain is not supported.
However, as usual, old wallet versions are still supported.

Downgrading warning
-------------------

The chainstate database for this release is not compatible with previous
releases, so if you run 0.15 and then decide to switch back to any
older version, you will need to run the old release with the `-reindex-chainstate`
option to rebuild the chainstate data structures in the old format.

If your node has pruning enabled, this will entail re-downloading and
processing the entire blockchain.

Compatibility
==============

Bitcoin Knots is supported on multiple operating systems using the Linux kernel,
macOS 10.8+, and Windows Vista and later. Windows XP is not supported.

Bitcoin Knots should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not
frequently tested on them.


Notable changes
===============

Network fork safety enhancements
--------------------------------

A number of changes to the way Bitcoin Knots deals with peer connections and invalid blocks
have been made, as a safety precaution against blockchain forks and misbehaving peers.

- Unrequested blocks with less work than the minimum-chain-work are now no longer processed even
if they have more work than the tip (a potential issue during IBD where the tip may have low-work).
This prevents peers wasting the resources of a node. 

- Peers which provide a chain with less work than the minimum-chain-work during IBD will now be disconnected.

- For a given outbound peer, we now check whether their best known block has at least as much work as our tip. If it
doesn't, and if we still haven't heard about a block with sufficient work after a 20 minute timeout, then we send
a single getheaders message, and wait 2 more minutes. If after two minutes their best known block has insufficient
work, we disconnect that peer. We protect 4 of our outbound peers from being disconnected by this logic to prevent
excessive network topology changes as a result of this algorithm, while still ensuring that we have a reasonable
number of nodes not known to be on bogus chains.

- Outbound (non-manual) peers that serve us block headers that are already known to be invalid (other than compact
block announcements, because BIP 152 explicitly permits nodes to relay compact blocks before fully validating them)
will now be disconnected.

- If the chain tip has not been advanced for over 30 minutes, we now assume the tip may be stale and will try to connect
to an additional outbound peer. A periodic check ensures that if this extra peer connection is in use, we will disconnect
the peer that least recently announced a new block.

- The set of all known invalid-themselves blocks (i.e. blocks which we attempted to connect but which were found to be
invalid) are now tracked and used to check if new headers build on an invalid chain. This ensures that everything that
descends from an invalid block is marked as such.


Faster initial blockchain sync for pruned nodes
-----------------------------------------------

When performing the initial sync, pruning will more aggressively get rid of old data to avoid having to prune too often. This can result in a significant performance improvement.


Various GUI improvements
------------------------

- Send tab has a button to send your entire available balance.

- Transaction search now understands transaction ids.

- Transaction list now shows labels and/or addresses, for send-to-self entries.

- The debug window peer list now has columns for data sent and received from
  each peer.


GUI settings backed up on reset
-------------------------------

The GUI settings will now be written to `guisettings.ini.bak` in the data directory before wiping them when
the `-resetguisettings` argument is used. This can be used to retroactively troubleshoot issues due to the
GUI settings.


Duplicate wallets disallowed
----------------------------

Previously, it was possible to open the same wallet twice by manually copying the wallet file, causing
issues when both were opened simultaneously. It is no longer possible to open copies of the same wallet.


Debug `-minimumchainwork` argument added
----------------------------------------

A hidden debug argument `-minimumchainwork` has been added to allow a custom minimum work value to be used
when validating a chain.


Low-level RPC changes
----------------------

- `addmultisigaddress` and `createmultisig` will no longer permit uncompressed
  keys to be used when sorting, since BIP 67 forbids this.

- `dumpwallet` no longer allows overwriting files. This is a security measure
  as well as prevents dangerous user mistakes.

- `backupwallet` will now fail when attempting to backup to source file, rather than
  destroying the wallet.

- `getblockchaininfo` now includes `initialblockdownload` to indicate the node
  sync state, as well as the blockchain `size_on_disk`, `prune_target_size`,
  and whether `automatic_pruning` is enabled.

- `getmempoolancestors`, `getmempooldescendants`, `getmempoolentry`, and (in
  verbose mode) `getrawmempool` now include the wtxid and weight of mempool
  entries.

- An experimental utility `getsignaturehash` RPC is introduced, for external
  signing tools.

- `listsinceblock` will now throw an error if an unknown `blockhash` argument
  value is passed, instead of returning a list of all wallet transactions since
  the genesis block. The behaviour is unchanged when an empty string is provided.

- The named parameters and results for `rescanblockchain` have been renamed to
  include an underscore (eg, `start_height`). This release preserves
  compatibility with the deprecated names, but they will be removed in the
  future.

- `signrawtransaction` and `verifyscript` can in some cases return human-
  readable error messages. This now correctly identifies CLEANSTACK violation
  errors.
